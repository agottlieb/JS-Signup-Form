This is a Javascript validation form from Frontendmentor.io. I learned how to use server-side Javascript for validating information. I also added an eventlistener to the form to check if the form updated correctly after user input. The fields automtically remove the error message once the information is fixed. This automatic update is run only after the user has pushed the button once. Iused Google Dev Tools to troubleshoot the Javascript issues. This is a mobile first design using HTML5, CSS and flexbox. 

Known bug: The red warning label for the password renders oddly on the Vercel site.

The project is based on a Frontend Mentor project:
